# Restaurant-Simulator
A final project for my C++ class part 2 (CIST 2362) that simulates a restaurant work day

The restarant sim can be viewed by openeding the "Final Project" visual studio project file.
There are many factors to go into the restarant making money.
The user will input the following info:

1. Restaurant Name
2. Restaurant Style (Changes various customer habits such as wait time and how much a customer is willing to put up with)
3. Number of Tables
4. Customer Frequency (This value gets altered by the program based on time of day)
5. Number of hours the simulator will run for (limited to 3 hour, 5 hour, or 7 hours)
6. Hour the simulator will start (6 for 6AM or PM)
7. AM or PM (in regaurd to the last value)
8. Number of Servers (Waiters/Waitresses)
9. Adjust the values for the servers
10. Number of Cooks 
11. Adjust the values for the cooks

Wait 5 minutes and watch the simulation run realtime
At the end of the simulation, you can view the results of the simulation as well as a small breakdown of statistics based on the preformace of your staff
